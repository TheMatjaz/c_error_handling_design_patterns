Error handling design patterns in non-OOP languages
================================================================

A academic research on how errors are handled by developers in 
programming languages that do not support Exceptions, using 
mainly examples from ISO C.


Topics
----------------------------------------

- A brief recap over Exceptions
- Return codes
  - Boolean codes
  - Error codes
  - Error flags
- Code design choices with return codes
- Using the return value's domain
- Embedded error indicator in value
- `<errno.h>`
- `<setjmp.h>`
